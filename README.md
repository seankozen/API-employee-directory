# Project-8
 API Employee Directory
includes search capability and ability to switch back and forth between employees in the modal window.
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images: [https://github.com/seankozen/API-employee-directory/blob/main/images/employee_directory.png]

## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed from the index.html file.
- Responsive CSS using Sass preprocessor: [https://github.com/seankozen/API-employee-directory/tree/main/scss]
- The application fetches data from the Random User Generator API: [https://github.com/seankozen/API-employee-directory/blob/main/app.js]
- Creation of modal in the index.html file.
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but for this project I focused on the
  frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Recreate using React.js.
